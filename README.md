# learning

A running log of things I'm learning to build (and refresh) strong core software engineering skills, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence.

## Core Skills

### Python Programming
I've been writing Python code for several years and consider myself to be fluent - however I know there's some dark spots and programming patterns/paradigms I may not have come across. I'm hoping to breeze through some fundamentals as a refresher and move on to more complex topics later

### Linux & Command Line
I'm pretty confident working with the shell and writing basic scripts, but it can be a powerful tool for automations and improving my workflow.

### Databases
Having spent several years working with Python based [ORMs](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1279678/9714115), I'd like to develop some more robust SQL skills.

### Maths
I really enjoyed maths throughout school & university, but haven't kept the fundamentals fresh. I'm largely going to focus on statistics, but might branch out!
